![](https://bwec-file.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/cms/90cb2f40-fc48-11e8-b129-0b5b40cbbba3.jpg)

### No Transaction, No Fee 

As a shipowner/ship management company, you don't need to pay any service fee to the platform for a third party transaction.

As a supplier, it's also free to set up an online store and display products and services on the platform until you get an order online, you only need to pay a small percentage of Transaction Service Fee based on the transaction amount. 

**The fee schedule is as follows:**

<table>
